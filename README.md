# react-starter
Starter project for a single page web application using react and webpack. 

## Getting Started ##

Step one is to get all the dependencies installed. This project requires
node and npm. Install those first, then run

    npm install

This project uses webpack with wepback-dev-server. To start working, run

    npm run dev

and go to <http://localhost:8080>. Once started, wepback will watch your
source files for changes and automatically rebuild and refresh the browser.
